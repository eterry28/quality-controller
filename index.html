                <div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">What types of testing do you do?</span>
                    <p><span class="headline hl4">by Eric Terry</span></p>
                </div>
                <p>There are many types of tests in software QC. Here are the most common types our team conducts:</p>
                <em>Smoke</em>
                <p>This is a simple test to make sure the build is testable. We check to make sure the assets load correctly and are connected to the appropriate subsystems. This is the first step of any testing effort.</p>
                
                <em>Exploratory</em>
                <p>This test explores the main functional components of a site or asset without having knowledge of requirements. Our team cannot validate that the asset works as expected.</p>

                <em>Regression</em>
                <p>Retests an already tested asset, after an update, to find any defects that may have been introduced. This is the most common type of test our team conducts.</p>

                <em>Full System</em>
                <p>This tests to validate the system against the full set of requirements. These are most common on brand new sites, platform migrations, or major site redesigns.</p>

                <em>Visual Comparison</em>
                <p>This is an automated process to test visual differences between baseline and checkpoint versions of websites. We are working to incorporate banners, emails, and Veeva sales aids. We conduct these tests after deploying code to a new environment.</p>
                
                <em>Automation</em>
                <p>Specialized tools and techniques are used to execute pre-defined test cases against a software application in automated software testing. This process ensures the quality and reliability of our software in a systematic and repeatable manner.</p>

                <p>Have you ever thought to yourself, "I wonder what those testers are doing all day"? No worries. This article will help elucidate the matter.</p>
                
                <figure class="figure">

                <p>The test professionals here at Intouch Eversana have a method they follow. It is called the <em>Software Testing Life Cycle</em>, or <em>STLC</em>. There are 6 areas of concern, or phases in the STLC: Requirements analysis; Test planning; Test case development; Test environment setup; Test execution; and Test cycle closure. Each of these phases are equally important in testing software.</p>

                <em>Requirements Analysis</em>
                <p>The test lead reads through the requirements to get a picture of what needs to be tested. They seek to understand the expectation of how the asset is supposed to function. The lead meets with BSAs, developers, and other stakeholders for clarification. The last thing we want to do is assume how something is to work.</p>

                <em>Test Planning</em>
                <p>The Test Lead puts together the testing strategy in this phase. They are concerned with the objectives of the test. What will be tested and what will be excluded. The Test Lead will provide an estimate of the testing effort needed to complete the testing. They work with the Resource Manager to get additional help with test execution. They start planning what is needed in the test environment.</p>

                <span class="citation">"The Test Lead will provide an estimate of the testing effort."</span>

                <em>Test Case Development</em>
                <p>This is the third phase of the STLC. Here, the Test Lead designs the test cases in detail. These test cases will be used during test execution. Tests should be easy to follow. They should generate the same result each time they are executed.</p>
                
                <em>Test Environment Setup</em>
                <p>The Test Lead is making sure the correct asset is in place to test. They also secure any hardware or devices needed to execute the test cases.</p>
                
                <em>Test Execution</em>
                <p>This is the phase that most people think of when the topic of testing comes up. Testers execute the test cases. Testers mark test cases as passed if they successfully execute them. They mark failing test cases as failed. Tests can also be blocked due to failed other failed tests.</p>

                <em>Test Cycle Closure</em>
                <p>This is the final phase in the STLC. The Test Lead communicates the test summary report to the project team. The report contains: the Status; Progress Summary; Significant Events; and a list of Defect Details</p>

                <p>You are now equiped with more knowledge about the activites testers do on a daily basis. Hopefully this helps clear up why we ask for things like timelines to be updated, or to be invited to whisk, blend, and kickoff meetings. Please reach out to your Test Lead or me if you have any questions.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We catch up with Deb Lebakken in today's issue of <u>The Quality Controller</u>. We want you to get to know a bit more about our amazing colleague and Team Lead.</p>
                <p><em>Q: What do most people misunderstand about your field of work?</em></p>
                <p>A: Most people believe our job in Quality Assurance is to "find defects".  Unless the code is only a couple of pages long, we can never find all of them.  (When it comes to defects, 80% of the defects are found in 20% of the code.)  There are actually 7 principles of testing:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.</li>
                    <li>Exhaustive testing is impossible.</li>
                    <li>Early testing saves time and money.</li>
                    <li>Defects cluster together.</li>
                    <li>Beware of the pesticide paradox.</li>
                    <li>Testing is context dependent.</li>
                    <li>Absence-of-errors is a fallacy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
